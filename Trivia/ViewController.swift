// Create a trivia game application consisting of at least 8 questions
//If the user guesses a question correctly, the background of the app should flash green, and the user should be taken to the next question
//If the user chooses an incorrect answer, the background of the app should flash red, and that answer should be disabled
//If the user gets more than 3 questions wrong, the user should lose the game
//At the end of the game, your app should show the user their score
//The user should be able to start over when the game ends
